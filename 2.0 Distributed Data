Reasons for distributing database over multiple machines:
Scalability - Data volume, read and write load can grow bigger than a single machine
Fault tolerance/high availability - when one machine fails another can take over (multiple machines provide redundancy)
Latency - Users in different locations can be served by datacenters which are closer to them (avoid network delays)
