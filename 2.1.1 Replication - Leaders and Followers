3 Main Purposes - reduce latency by being geographically closer, allow system to continue working even if some components fail, serve more queries by scaling out machines. All issues with replication occur when the data is modified.
3 types of replication - single-leader, multi-leader, leaderless
Trade-offs with replication - synchronous/asynchronous and what to do with failed replicas

Leaders and Followers
Replica is a node that stores copy of data. Leader and follower concepts arise when discussing writes being propogated to all replicas. Leader-based replication is also known as active-passive or master-slave.
1. One of the replicas is called leader. When application writes, it sends the request to leader which writes the data to local storage.
2. Then the leader sends new data to all followers in form of a Replication Log or Change Stream. Each follower writes these changes to local storage in the same order as they were written on leader.
3. Reads can be performed at leader or follower while writes are performed only at leader.
Used in MySQL, MongoDB, distributed message brokers such as Kafka and ActiveMQ

Synchronous vs Asynchronous Replication
Once a write request is submitted, at some point the leader notifies the client that request was successful. In synchronous replication, leader waits for acknowledgement from follower that it received the request before sending success to client (and making write visible to other clients). In asynchronous, the leader responds with a success soon after forwarding request to follower.
If response from follower is slow, async is preferred (usually replication is fast, less than a second).

Adv of sync - guarantee that follower received request and data is available if leader goes down
Disadv of sync - if follower goes down, leader can't process the request and has to halt all requests till follower is back

All followers can't be synchronous as the entire systems stops if one node doesn't respond. Some (at least one) followers can be sync and others async. So at least 2 nodes will have latest data. This is called Semi-Synchronous. If sync follower goes down, an async follower is upgraded to sync.

Adv of async - writes can be processed at leader even if all followers are down
Disadv of async - writes that are not processed at followers can be lost
Purely async is used if many followers are in separate locations

Setting up new followers
Needed to increase no. of replicas or replace failed nodes. Need a mechanism other than simple copy of DB files in file system. Data is always being written and is in flux - causes inconsistency at different nodes. Locking the database makes it unavailable for writes (high availability compromised). Must be done without downtime. Steps are:
a. Take a snapshot of the leader's database at some point in time - without locking the database
b. Copy this snapshot to the newly created follower node
c. Follower connects to leader and requests all data changes that have happened at the leader node since the last snapshot (associated with an exact position in the leader's replication log.
d. Once the follower processes all these latest data changes, it has caught up to the leader. It can continue normal functionality of processing further data changes from the leader node.

Handling node outages
Node outages occur either due to faults or planned downtime. Ability to reboot nodes without downtime is a big advantage. So, system as a whole must be available inspite of individual node failures.

Follower failure is done via "Catch-up recovery" : When the follower goes down or network conn. goes down, the follower knows the last transaction that was processed. It connects back to the leader and requests all data changes that occurred since last successful transation. After processing these, it is caught up, and resumes normal processing of request at leader.

Leader failure is done via "Failover" : One of the followers is promoted to new leader; Clients are reconfigured to send requests to new leader; Followers start consuming data changes from the new leader. Failover can be manual/auto. Steps are:
a. Determine if leader is dead - Issues could be crashes, power outage, network issues. Nodes bounce messages back and forth and if a leader node hasn't responded for 30s or so - it's considered dead (no foolproof way to know)
b. Choose new leader - Either via Election Process (by remaining nodes) or Assignement by a predetermined Controller Node. Best candidate is node with the latest data changes (minimize data loss)
c. Reconfigure system - Clients need to send request to new leader. When old leader comes back, it might still behave as a leader not realizing it's been asked to step down by other nodes - ensure it behaves as a follower and recognizes new leader

Issues with Failover
a. In asynchronous replication scenario, the new leader may not have received all writes from old leader and the new leader might have received conflicting write requests. Usual method is to discard old leader's unreplicated writes - durability is compromised
b. Discarding writes affects systems outside database which need to be coordinated with DB. (Ex - primary keys might become inconsistent in DB and outside system - because some PKs got reused by new leader)
c. It could happen that two nodes behave as leader and accept writes - can result in inconsistency and conflicts. This is known as "Split-Brain". Usually one of the two nodes is forcibly shutdown (fencing) - but both nodes could end up getting shut down.
d. Timeout values to determine dead leader node - too long means TTR is longer and too short means unnecessary failovers. (spike in traffic could increase response time of a node - false positive)

Implementation of Replication Logs
Statement-Based Replication - Leader logs every request or "Statement" that it executes and sends the replication log to its followers. The follower parses these statements and executes as if it's received from a client. Issues with this are:
a. Any statement that calls a non-deterministic function (RAND() or NOW()) will return different values on each node
b. If the statements use an auto-incrementing column or if they depend on existing data, then statements must be executed in the same exact order on each node, to get same result (this is a problem when there are multiple concurrently executing transactions)
c. Statements have different side-effects on different replicas (stored procs, triggers, UDF) unless effects are deterministic

Write-Ahead-Log (WAL) Shipping
Here the log is an append-only sequence of bytes containing all writes to the database. Exact same log is used to build a replica - log is written to disk + sent to followers. When follower processes this, it builds an exact copy of the data structures as on the leader. The log describes data at a low-level - which bytes are modified on which disk blocks. So, replication is closely coupled to storage engine - if storage format version is changed, it's not possible to run different version of DB software on leader and follower.
If replication protocol allows follower to use newer software version, a zero-downtime upgrade of DB software can be done - by upgrading followers and then promoting one to leader. Otherwise downtime is needed DB software upgrade.

Logical (row-based) log replication
Use different log formats for replication and storage engine (decouples repl. log from storage engine internals). Hence it's called logical log, compared to storage engine's "Physical" data representation. A sequence of records desc. writes to DB tables based on row:
a. For inserted row, log contains values of all columns
b. For deleted row, log contains info to uniquely identify row - PK or old values of all columns
c. For updated row, log contains info to uniquely identify row plus new values of all/updated columns
Due to decoupling, leader and follower can be more backward compatible, running different versions of DB software or storage engines. Logical log format is easier for external apps to parse (send DB contents to warehouse, build custom index/cache). This is called "Change Data Capture"

Trigger-based replication
This involves repl. by application code rather than by DB system above. Need to replicate subset of data, from one kind of DB to another or you need conflict resolution logic. (Features such as triggers or stored procs.) Triggers allow registration of custom appl. logic which is executed when data change occures - trigger can log this change to separate table which can be ready by external process. The external process applies logic and replicate to a diff. system. This approach is more prone to bugs and limitations but is flexible
