Things that can go wrong in data systems:
 DB software or hardware may fail (even in middle of an operation)
 Application may crash anytim (halfway thru a series of operations)
 Nw interruptions can cut off appl from DB or DB nodes from each other
 Several clients write to DB overwriting each others changes
 Client reads data that doesn't make sense since it's only partially written
 Race conditions b/w clients can cause unexpected bugs
Reliable systems have to deal with these to prevent catastrophe. Implementing fault tolerance mechanisms is tough - think about everything that can go wrong, test everything to ensure it solves the problems
